1 0.000 58564 NULL Only 2-polarisations recorded for noise source signal
1 0.000 58570 NULL Noise source time synchronisation was incorrect. Therefore the ON and OFF noise source channels will be in error.
1 0.000 58660 NULL Metadata logging with relatively low cadence.
1 59386 59401 NULL Subbands 11 and 12 are missing one polarisation channel.
1 0.000 59416 NULL The astronomy and noise source data streams are not normalised by the number of hits in each spectral channel
1 0.000 59425 NULL The data tables were recorded with 5-dimensions. After MJD 59425 we record 4-dimensions (without beam number).
1 0.000 59418 topoFreqError.txt Topocentric frequency labelling in the SDHDF files incorrect
